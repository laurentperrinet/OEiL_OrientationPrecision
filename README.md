Hi,

I am designing a pilot experiment online and I would like to ask you if you could give me 5 minutes of your time to improve it.

You will be shown a texture and asked to judge whether it is tilted from the vertical. 

To answer, either press the left arrow (or swipe left on a tablet) if you think the texture is tilted to the left = \ = counter-clockwise and otherwise to the right = / = clockwise. 


It should take no more than 5 minutes (216 images). It would be great if you could give me feedback ('too many images' 'not enough' 'I don't like the colour' ...) to improve the experiment. Based on this pilot and your feedback, I could run another experiment and publish it online... I have 20 sessions so far and the results are consistent so far and were performed in about 4minutes and a half in average.

(warning : this pilot is plain - no instructions and such)

many thanks
Laurent
